# 🕒 Shortest Job First Scheduling Algorithm

## Overview 📜

This project implements the Shortest Job First Scheduling (SJFS) algorithm, also known as Shortest Job Next (SJN), in C++. SJFS is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm that selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time to execute next, aiming to minimize the average waiting time of processes.

## Features 🌟

- 🖊️ **User Input**: Allows users to input the arrival time and burst time for each process.
- 🛠️ **SJFS Implementation**: Implements the SJFS algorithm to schedule processes based on their burst times.
- 📊 **Metrics Calculation**: Calculates various metrics including completion time, waiting time, turnaround time, and average waiting time for all processes.
- 📈 **Output Visualization**: Displays the scheduling results in a tabular format for easy understanding.

## How to Use 🚀

1. ⚙️ **Compile the Source Code**: Compile the `SJFS.cpp` file using a C++ compiler:
2. ▶️ **Run the Executable**: Execute the compiled executable or run the exe file:
3. ✍️ **Input Process Details**: Follow the prompts to input the number of processes and the arrival time and burst time for each process.
4. 👀 **View Scheduling Results**: After providing the necessary inputs, the program will calculate various metrics and display them in a formatted table.
