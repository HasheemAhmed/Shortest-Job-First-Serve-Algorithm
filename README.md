# Shortest-Job-First-Serve-Algorithm
Shortest Job First Scheduling Algorithm Implementation in C++

This project implements the Shortest Job First Scheduling (SJFS) algorithm, also known as Shortest Job Next (SJN), in C++. SJFS is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm that selects the waiting process with the smallest execution time to execute next, aiming to minimize the average waiting time of processes.

Features
User Input: Allows users to input the arrival time and burst time for each process.
SJFS Implementation: Implements the SJFS algorithm to schedule processes based on their burst times.
Metrics Calculation: Calculates various metrics including completion time, waiting time, turnaround time, and average waiting time for all processes.
Output Visualization: Displays the scheduling results in a tabular format for easy understanding.

How to Use
Clone the Repository: Clone the repository to your local machine.
Compile the Source Code: Compile the FCFS.cpp file using a C++ compiler.
Run the Executable: Execute the compiled executable.
Input Process Details: Follow the prompts to input the number of processes and the arrival time and burst time for each process.
View Scheduling Results: After providing the necessary inputs, the program will calculate various metrics and display them in a formatted table.
